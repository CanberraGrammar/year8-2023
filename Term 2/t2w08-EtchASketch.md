# Etch-A-Sketch

## Tasks

1. Get a functioning Etch-A-Sketch if you did not get to it last week.
2. Make drawn pixels disappear after 700 unique pixels have been drawn, starting with the oldest pixels (so it should look like it's un-drawing your pixels after some time).
    1. Note that if you got connected lines working last week, it's recommended you change back to simple single-pixel drawing to start off with for this task.
3. The same as task 2 but using connected dots.
    1. And if you didn't get connected dots working last week, try doing that now!

# Etch-A-Sketch

## Wiring
Wire an OLED screen and two potentiometers into your Raspberry Pi Pico. The wiring diagrams for an OLED screen and a single potentiometer are provided in the session.

## Activities
1. Make it work. 
2. Add a button to erase the screen when it gets pressed.
3. Rewire that button to now be a 'pick-up pen' button. This means that while you are holding the buton down you can turn the potentiometer knobs to move the drawing pixel to a new location, and let go to see where the pixel is now.
4. (Extension) Add preview functionality to the pick-up pen button in Step 3. That is, the location of the new drawing pixel should be shown, and should move around without drawing a line behind it.
